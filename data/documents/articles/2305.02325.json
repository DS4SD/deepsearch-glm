In Europe, 300 million overall. In France, with the decree published in the Official Gazette in 2022, killing the male chicks hatched from the eggs in the hatcheries that produce laying hens is prohibited. The law states that eggs can be killed by selection in the first 15 days of the 21-day incubation period, and any culling after 15 days is prohibited [1]. In Germany, a similar law will be enacted in 2024, banning embryo culling after the first seven days [2]. It is foreseen that such laws will become widespread daily, especially in Europe. In commercial hatcheries, eggs can be used as food when sexing is known before the eggs are incubated. This does not seem possible without an invasive method.
