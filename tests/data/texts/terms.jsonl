{"text": "France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ⓘ), officially the French Republic (French: République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛːz]),[14] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of over 68 million as of January 2023.[5][8] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Nice."}
{"text": "We study the effects of interband pairing in two-band s-wave and d-wave superconductors with D4h symmetry in both time-reversal invariant as well as time-reversal symmetry breaking states. The presence of interband pairing qualitatively changes the nodal structure of the superconductor: nodes can (dis)appear, merge, and leave high-symmetry locations when interband pairing is tuned. Furthermore, in the d-wave case, we find that also the boundary modes change qualitatively when interband pairing increases: flat zero-energy Andreev bound states gap out and transition to helical edge states."}
