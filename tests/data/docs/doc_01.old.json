      "text": "Knowledge Graphs have been fast emerging as the de facto standard to model and explore knowledge in weakly structured data. Large corpora of documents constitute a source of weakly structured data of particular interest for both the academic and business world. Key examples include scientific publications, technical reports, manuals, patents, regulations, etc. Such corpora embed many facts that are elementary to critical decision making or enabling new discoveries. In this paper, we present a scalable cloud platform to create and serve Knowledge Graphs, which we named corpus processing service (CPS). Its purpose is to process large document corpora, extract the content and embedded facts, and ultimately represent these in a consistent knowledge graph that can be intuitively queried. To accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art natural language understanding models to extract entities and relationships from documents converted with our previously presented corpus conversion service platform. This pipeline is complemented with a newly developed graph engine which ensures extremely performant graph queries and provides powerful graph analytics capabilities. Both components are tightly integrated and can be easily consumed through REST APIs. Additionally, we provide user interfaces to control the data ingestion flow and formulate queries using a visual programming approach. The CPS platform is designed as a modular microservice system operating on Kubernetes clusters. Finally, we validate the quality of queries on our endto-end knowledge pipeline in a real-world application in the oil and gas industry.",

As such, the CCS solves the first problem when confronted with a large corpus of documents, that is, make the content of the documents programmatically accessible. Examples of the latter would be ' List all images with their caption from the corpus or list all titles with their publication date. ' The second problem is to obviously search or explore the content of the documents in a large corpus. For this problem, we have developed the corpus processing service (CPS), which we present in this paper. The CPS is intended to create knowledge bases (KBs) from the converted JSON corpus and serve these KBs through in-memory knowledge graph stores. As such, the CPS is the natural extension of the CCS and has as an express purpose to make corpora of documents available for deep data exploration.",

Although search is by no means trivial, many state-of-the art solutions exist for this purpose. * We argue, however, that one needs query capabilities which allow for a combination of extracted facts and a fast, onthe-fly creation of new datasets to enable actual deep data exploration.

Relationships in the KG are strictly defined between the entities. Similar to the entities, the relationships are typed (' has-material-property ' or ' has-geological-age ').

In addition to extraction, the entity aggregation task also applies a similarity metric \u00b6 between the entities during extraction. This similarity metric will define if two entities refer to the same language concept and thus need to be represented by a single entity in the KG, rather than remaining separated. In Figure 1, we have illustrated the aggregation task for two types of entities across many different document components. These entity types could be for example materials and properties or geological formations and geological ages. The links connecting the new entities to their source entity are weighted according to the frequency of the match, that is, we set a higher weight if the language entity has been found multiple times. From an implementation point of view, the aggregation task for entities is nontrivial. In distributed computing, it corresponds to a reduction operation. Our implementation distributes the iteration of the source elements among all available computational resources. The aggregation is first performed in a local buffer, which is then synchronized with the backend database only when it reaches a maximum size. The synchronization step is a simple atomic update into an existing (or a newly created) database object. The synchronization for updates from each worker task does not collide with the others.",

The adjacency list format is very well suited for node-centric operations since it exploits data-locality for local graph operations, such as first order traversals. However, it proves suboptimal for global scale graph operations, which are required for deep queries and the advanced graph analytics. Here, one typically has to perform graph-traversals starting from many (or even all) nodes and accumulating the weight in the resulting nodes. In an adjacency list format, this often leads to many cache misses during execution, resulting in low performance. Furthermore, parallelizing global graph-traversals in the adjacency list format suffers significantly from concurrent write conflicts between threads during execution. In the adjacency matrix format, these problems are not encountered. The graph-traversals can be directly translated into a SpMV or even a sparse-matrix sparse-vector multiplication (SpMSpV). It has also been well established how to execute the SpMV effectively in a multithreaded fashion, and how to minimize cache-misses by applying a clever sorting of the tuples list. 17",

Firstly, our graph engine is able to run easily third, fourth, and even higher-order graph traversals. With Neo4J, this proves very difficult, as the TTS grows upwards of 1 hour. Secondly, our graph engine shows minimal variance in the TTS between all runs of the k-order graph-traversals.

This is typically done by describing a basin or one of its sub-regions. In practice, ' describing a basin ' boils down to identifying all geological formations with their properties in the basin and investigating if these formations constitute a petroleum system. 19 In its most minimalistic form, a petroleum system is defined by three components: source, reservoir, and seal. The source is the rock formation in which the oil or gas was created. Once created, the oil or gas typically migrates to a porous reservoir rock, which holds the oil and gas. In order for the oil and gas not to escape, the reservoir needs to be covered by an impermeable rock formation which is called the seal. Each one of these components is comprised of one or more formations, with a certain age and rock composition. To identify a petroleum system in a certain geographical area, one has to find a candidate formation for each component (ie, reservoir, seal, and source) and observe that the properties of these components satisfy some well-established constraints. For example, the reservoir",

First, the top-1 numbers are in the range of 0.75-0.9, meaning that for 3 in 4 cases, the most relevant result predicted by the KG was correct (precision). Secondly, we observe that the top-5 numbers are very high (\u2265 0.97), showing that the system was able detect and aggregate most of the PSEs and their properties (recall). Thus, the recall of the language annotators in the KG creation pipeline was very satisfactory.",
